Recalled are 2019-2020 Cadillac XT4 vehicles with video processing modules (VPM) that may lose communication with the rearview cameras.  This will cause the rearview camera image to fail.  GM opened an investigation in August following backup camera failures in 2020 Cadillac XT4 SUVs. The automaker found increased warranty claims for camera failures on 2019 and 2020 XT4s.  GM also received nearly 850 field reports between December 28, 2018, to September 19, 2022.  According to General Motors, the problem with the video processing module is a software anomaly that allows the communication issues.  A Cadillac XT4 driver may notice a problem if the backup camera image is replaced with a black or blue screen.  Cadillac expects to mail XT4 recall letters January 9, 2022, and dealers will update the processing modules. In addition, the video processing modules will be replaced in 2019 Cadillac XT4 SUVs.  Cadillac XT4 owners who want to learn more about the recall should call 800-458-8006 and ask about rearview camera image recall number N222373320. from this website: [XXX]  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",BACK OVER PREVENTION,6664.0

Every picture I have seen looks just like mine, a rusty L shaped crack adjacent to a crossmember welded on the backside of this area. You can see the shape of this crossmember through the surface of the I beam, indicating the metal is quite thin. It took me only a couple minutes to find, as I knew exactly where to look, based on the numerous stories I’ve read about. Upon further inspection, I also found suspect welds that look burned through the frame, leaving a hole behind. This makes me question the quality of the rest of the trailer’s frame.  There is also a crossmember at the front of the trailer with a distinct bend in it at the bottom, where the top remains fairly straight. This, to me, is another indication that the frame is flexing and causing this member to fold as a result.

The owner of the vehicle was unable to say limit to only 10 over the speed limit; instead it was percent based and not reliable. In addition, more than a third of the time - the speed limits in the infotainment system did not match the posted speed limits. Sometimes, in the middle of a highway - it would randomly go from 55 to 25, posing a significant threat hazard when using the FSD or cruise control system (which is something Tesla charges extra for access to) causing the vehicle to immediately decrease speed when other vehicles behind are getting up to speed and not expecting a vehicle to randomly slow down excessively. Additionally, when you manually override the speed limit control, or the system does, the user interface hides this limit so the driver is unaware of what limit of speed it is set to. These issues were already bad enough, but just yesterday my vehicle was pushed a software update that dramatically reduced the performance of FSD, and now I am unable to manually control the speed limit at all in FSD. This was a regression from purchase, when a scroll wheel at least allowed me to manually set the speed limit or correct it when it was wrong. Now, that feature has been removed and instead there’s a duplication of FSD profiles (left/right on the right scroll wheel does the same as scrolling up/down). And continuing this trend, the driver is incapable of seeing what the speed limit is set to because it’s hidden from the user interface. In addition, the driving behavior for FSD has significantly regressed from before the update. Cruise control’s most basic functionality should be to set a speed limit.

Due to the vehicle's poor natural visibility, there is a high reliance on the camera systems functioning properly.

Vehicle alerted to the following codes on the dash; ESCAPE, Traction Control, Check Engine Light, Brake System Failure, ""Do not exceed 62 MPH"". I took foot off accelerator and looked up and noticed the traffic light turning red. I applied pressure to the brake and noticed there was no brake pressure at all, and the vehicle continued to roll forward towards the intersection. I put the truck in low gear to slow and continued to pump the brake rapidly. As the truck gradually slowed I turned truck off until it came to a stop. When I restarted the truck the brake hydraulic pressure returned and only the check engine light remained on. I took the truck to Reliable GMC in the Roseville Automall the next morning. The service department claimed the AGM Battery was bad and caused the front brake caliper sensor to throw a low voltage code causing a cascade event of codes throughout the system. The loss of my brakes nearly caused me to enter an intersection unwillingly and could have led to a serious accident.

QT5 is for manual gate function with EZ lift, power lock release. The recall blames water intrusion into these vehicles’ tailgates that can come into contact with the electronic gate-release switch, potentially causing a short circuit, which may inadvertently unlatch and open the tailgate when in park. The correction is to replace the exterior touchpad switch assembly with part number 85734717.  My vehicle has RPO code QT6, which is for power up/down gate function with power lock and release. That option uses the same exterior touchpad switch assembly with part number 85734717. My vehicle did exhibit the same problem of opening unexpectedly while in park. That exterior touchpad switch eventually stopped opening or closing the tailgate altogether, and occasionally the tailgate would get stuck in the closed position while a dash message would say it is open. When it was immobilized in the closed position neither the exterior switch, the interior switch, or the key fob would make the tailgate open. It's my opinion that my vehicle experienced the same root problem as is described in the recall with the exterior switch assembly short circuiting, and that RPO code QT6 units should be included in the recall.",STRUCTURE,133126.0

I pulled over and discovered the seatbelt bracket was completely detached from the vehicle frame. The bolt was present, but the nut that secures the bracket was entirely missing, leaving the belt nonfunctional and my child at risk of serious injury or death in the event of a collision. This is a catastrophic failure of a federally regulated safety system.  I immediately contacted GMC and the dealership, explained the issue, and stated the vehicle was unsafe to drive. Despite this, I was told to drive the vehicle in for service on 6/9. The dealership confirmed the nut was never installed during manufacturing. However, instead of repairing the defect properly using OEM hardware and torque specs, the dealer used a generic lock nut found in their shop and said it “should hold.” No engineer signed off on the repair.  There were no warning lights or messages. The issue became apparent only after my son noticed the looseness.  The vehicle also has other documented issues: mirror folding failure, seat cushion defect, hydraulic frunk failure, swing gate malfunction (fixed), and a squeaky rear door. All were diagnosed on 2/28/25 and parts were ordered. I received no follow-up. When I returned on 6/9, nothing else was repaired.

We were forced to change the tire and tie up wires on the side of a busy highway in the dark with semi trucks passing us at 70mph plus.

I took the unit to Blue Compass in Katy, Texas and they discussed the issue with Keystone which resulted in the completion of what they called a flex test, basically they measure the distance between a fixed point in the hitch and the lower frame with the unit on ground on its jacks and then lift it on the king pin and make the same measurement, which I'm told needs to be 1/2"" max, mine was over 1"". So they took body work off to allow inspection of the main structural frame ( supplied by LCi) and aluminum framing and found broken aluminum framing welds, what appears to be cracked structural welds and a cut out on the structural frame which doesn't appear to meet their specification. The quality of the welding is poor at best with lots of undercut, blow holes, lack of fusion, lack of fill, etc, I'm assuming Keystone and LCi operate under self inspection.

Pictures and videos (even one of the crash) can be downloaded here:  [XXX]   Prior to the accident my husband set a backing up path “Home 1” within the BMW parking assist program for me to follow to align the car when backing into our driveway.  This takes over braking and steering to move the car on a predetermined path and stops at the end.  I have successfully used it many times.  It shows up as an option when backing near the top of our driveway.  In the video of the crash ([XXX]), the car turns into the driveway, slows to a rolling stop, and then continues back and crashes.  I pressed the “Start Home 1” icon to enable it when I thought the car was stopped but retrospectively was likely rolling very slowly at the top of the driveway.  The icon showed me the “Home 1” path as being accepted by changing from “Start Home 1” to “Cancel Home 1” thus I believed the car was following the “Home 1” path, but the car evidently did not actually engage “Home 1.”  My husband's investigation shows that this happens if the car is not fully stopped, even while the brake pedal is pressed, while pressing the “Start Home 1” button.  This behavior is documented in the mp4 ([XXX]).  I thought that “Home 1” was engaged and the car following the predetermined path, even though in retrospect, it was not. Evidently, the car was rolling backward in reverse on a downgrade NOT following the ""Home 1"" path.  The car gave me the opportunity to cancel the ""Home 1"" path even though the car wasn't following it!

While we understand and appreciate the many safety features on new cars, we feel this feature is a safety distraction and hazard. We have turned this feature off in the Driver Assistance Warning section and we have turned off the bell.  Despite this, this warning with its 5 loud distinct bells sounds very frequently and often automatically disengages our cruise control while we are driving on the highway. In a recent vacation road trip of over 3,000 miles, the enjoyment of our trip and our new car was greatly compromised.  During that time we tried to discern what actions we were doing to cause it to go off.  It would go off when looking at the gauges so we would try to look quick and then eyes back on the road.  We tried driving without sunglasses (which is a hazard  itself), making sure our hands were at the 11 and 2 position, looking straight ahead.  Nothing seemed to make a difference, it would go off randomly and often. Careful and safe driving requires a driver to scan the rear view and side mirrors, the gauges, be aware of other drivers proximity to your vehicle and avoid staring only straight ahead.  I am aware that there may be consideration of a mandate for all cars with this feature in the future, however, as of the time of purchase of this vehicle, this law did not exist and as such, we should have the right to choose to use this feature or not. We have contacted Hyundai Corporate and visited 3 dealers, none of whom would or could help except to tell us many others have voiced the same complaint.  In our opinion this system as it currently operates is more of a hazard than a safety feature.

The four vehicles listed on the SGOs were manufactured when Tesla referred to the ADAS hardware suite as Hardware 3.0 (HW3). This March 2022 video recorded an incident facing into the sun in a 2020 Tesla Model 3 with HW3 installed. Tesla's ADAS is engaged and operating on FSD Beta V10.10.2 firmware. A video sensor reacts to bright sun and shade by raising and lowering its sensitivity, which may compromise exposure if it occurs once. In a series of pulsed, high-contrast lighting changes, the exposure may be less than optimal during much of the transient. The depth and duration of the exposure error will vary by the sensor's make and model. Next, See:  [XXX] ) Only the video is relevant. The rear-facing camera view on the Tesla's display shows the shadow cast directly behind the vehicle, confirming direct alignment. At 0:51, the car enters a bridge section where cross-members cast shadows onto the windshield-mounted cameras, causing a pulsed lighting effect. If a video automatic gain adjustment (AGC) step is in the signal path downstream of the sensor, it may react adversely to the pulsed input. The signal path latency, processing time, and the attack and release settings of the AGC delay the output, making it out of sync with the sensor's direct output. Note: At 0:57, the driver requests a speed adjustment as the ADAS emerges from the strobed lighting. At 1:50, the visualization displays the VRUs as facing into the vehicle's path and the ultrasonics returning pings off the metal barrier to the right. Other: Social media reports indicate that interior condensation in front of the front-facing cameras can be resolved using the standard front-screen defrosting feature.

At highway speeds in 6th gear, a design issue with the gear position sensor causes the indicated gear to rapidly switch between 6th gear and 1st gear.  This has two effects: 1. Cruise control disengages 2. The engine shuts off and will not start again until the motorcycle is fully shut off (key turned to the off position and back on)  This reaction to the gear indicator reading results in the motorcycle abruptly engine braking at speeds up to 80 mph and an inability to restart the engine until stopped on the side of the road. There have been several times where this has happened to me where the motorcycle abruptly decelerates from 70-80 mph to below 60 mph in the span of seconds, causing following vehicles to have to slam on their brakes. If there was someone behind who was distracted, they would surely hit me as engine braking does not activate the brake lights.  This is a well known issue with this motorcycle and almost every 700clx has this issue. The only fix is through a warranty repair in which the entire shifter mechanism is removed and replaced with redesigned parts. This is not an issue with wear or broken parts, as the bikes do this straight from the factory almost 100% of the time.  If more evidence is required for a recall, you can look at the cfmoto 700clx owners Facebook group where almost everyone reports this issue.",VEHICLE SPEED CONTROL,144613.0

Backing out of my driveway I can expect that 25-50% of the time the car will slam on the brakes for no reason and apply the parking brake, which I then have to disengage manually to continue backing out. More recently, I was driving 30 mph on a city street with no one in front of me when without warning the Prologue slammed to a complete stop. Fortunately no one was behind me or I almost certainly would have been rear-ended.  After four months of owning the Prologue, and seeing this exact problem reported over and over again, it's evident the entire electronics system is glitchy at best and downright dangerous at worst. Everything from the crash-avoidance cameras (regularly issues messages that they're blocked when they're obviously not) to the remote starter (supposed to come on with two quick presses of a button on the fob, but often takes a dozen or more to actually activate) is borderline non-functional. Whether this is a software or a hardware problem, or some combination thereof, there's no question in my mind that sooner or later, as more of these vehicles are on the road, one of these malfunctions is going to cause a crash. I hope the NHTSA will see enough of a quorum of similar complaints to investigate before that happens. For my part, I've turned off all driver assist systems in my Prologue, which is the only way I can be assured the car will only brake when it should.

This issue has been ongoing since the first weeks of ownership and has not been repaired or properly diagnosed after multiple service visits. Details -Component/System Failed: Front suspension/brake assembly (unknown exact component; may involve control arms, bushings, or brake rotors). -Availability for Inspection: Yes, the vehicle and recorded videos are available for inspection upon request. -Safety Risk: The vehicle produces loud clunking or popping noises when driving between 10–20 mph or when turning and braking. It feels unstable and unsafe at times, especially on wet roads. This raises concern about potential front-end component failure while driving. -Reproduction and Confirmation: The issue has been reproduced and confirmed multiple times by Tesla Service in Vancouver, WA and Portland, OR. Tesla’s internal system shows that the issue was escalated for “in-car investigation by engineering,” but no permanent repair was completed. -Inspection History: Tesla technicians and engineers have inspected the vehicle several times. I also recorded multiple videos with cameras mounted inside the fender to document the sound and provide visual proof of the problem. -Warning Lamps or Messages: No warning lights appear. The issue is purely mechanical but noticeable during low-speed operation. The first symptoms appeared within the first month of delivery. -Manufacturer Contact: Tesla Service Centers in Vancouver and Portland are aware of the issue and have escalated it, but no resolution has been provided. This problem has continued for months despite repeated service visits. The vehicle was identified as needing further “factory-level investigation,” but I was told the local service centers cannot fix it.

On [xxx], my [XXX]  son briefly removed and reinserted the middle-row headrest while unsupervised. The headrest locked into place in a reversed orientation and could not be removed or corrected without disassembly by the dealership. I was charged $680 for the repair. This incident raises the following concerns: •The headrest should not be capable of locking in an incorrect and potentially unsafe position. •There are no warnings, labels, or mechanical safeguards to prevent reverse installation. •The owner's manual provides no guidance on this possibility. •This design flaw is particularly troubling in a family-oriented vehicle. •Hyundai has not acknowledged fault or offered support despite the safety implications. I believe this represents a design defect with implications under FMVSS 202a and related passenger safety standards. I am therefore requesting the following: 1.Full reimbursement of the $680 repair cost, which I believe resulted from a manufacturer design oversight. 2.Written acknowledgment of whether Hyundai has previously received similar reports, and whether a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) or other corrective measure is planned. 3.Confirmation that this report will be reviewed by Hyundai’s safety or compliance team. Attached is a copy of the dealer invoice (No. [XXX) documenting the repair. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

The weather conditions were not an issue; it was sunny and warm. I was in the left lane doing 77mph with the Cruise Control on. I had passed a vehicle in the right lane and it was now maybe 500 feet behind us, still in the right lane. Suddenly, the Tesla Model 3 braked hard for no reason. The car braked so hard that the tires were starting to squeal.   We were well inside the lane (had not drifted to either side). There were no obstacles in front of us. There was no discoloration on the highway from any repair or car fire. The road was completely visible.  The car's speed had dropped from 77mph to about 57mph before I could press on the gas to resume normal driving.   Had there been a car behind us, it's possible we could've been hit from behind. The car in the right lane did wind up passing us and I'm pretty sure they thought our driving was dangerous -- borderline insane.   There were no warning sounds, no alerts on the monitor.

The adaptive cruise control worked incredibly beautifully for years up until a few weeks ago - I think sometime in June 2023 (could have been May 2023). All of the sudden, I was *frequently* experiencing phantom braking, ie. braking with no explanation, while using adaptive cruise control. Sometimes the braking was gradual, other times more forceful. It would happen at random places - Sometimes in/near intersections or around other vehicles, other times just out on the open road with no vehicles or stoplights anywhere in sight. Even on a 20 minute drive, it can happen three or four times.  To me, this is a severe hazard. I have a disability, and I purchased this vehicle because of the incredible safety features. Prior to this, it has 100% lived up to what people said about it - just amazing. But now, the very reason I purchased this vehicle, its advanced safety features, I find not just unreliable but somewhat terrifying.  I *believe* that Tesla may have (effectively / unintentionally) disabled the built-in radar in vehicles like mine. This is because I've read online accounts of people with the same year having the same problems as mine, also at around the same time that mine started.  Specifically, my model year has radar built in. But I understand that newer Teslas rely solely on cameras, ie. ""Tesla Vision."" I understood that because my vehicle physically has radar installed, that my adaptive cruise control would still work at least as good as it had in the past - certainly not worse.  If this can't be fixed I'll be forced to sell the car, which I desperately don't want to do, as I love the car and I think the world of Tesla.

I immediately contacted the dealership, but they failed to return my call. I followed up a few days later, and they told me to bring the car in the next day.  When I went in, I explained my serious concerns. They told me they would need to keep the vehicle for 3 to 4 days just to diagnose the issue and that no courtesy car would be provided during that time. I made it clear that I rely on my car for work and had no alternative. I even pointed out that the dashboard warning was a diagnosis in itself. I asked to speak with a manager and repeated everything. He simply echoed what the advisor had said—and I was sent away with the vehicle, unresolved and still potentially unsafe.  On May 8th, 2025, around 5 PM, on a clear day, I missed a stop sign and collided with another car.  I firmly believe the forward collision system malfunctioned and that this accident could have been prevented had the system worked properly—or if the dealership had properly advised me not to drive the vehicle after such a critical warning.  In my view, the dealership was completely negligent, and the manufacturer was aware of a defect in the system and failed to act. I also contacted the finance company, Santander Consumer USA, to alert them in case other customers have the same vehicle with the same risk. They showed no concern.  It’s important to add that I did not choose this car myself. Santander limited me to specific dealerships and pre-approved vehicles. I had no freedom to select a car I truly wanted—perhaps because the available options were already considered poor choices.  I believe a recall is necessary. I lost my vehicle due to this negligence, and I want to prevent this from happening to someone else.

Fortunately, I had closed the sun shade two days prior while on vacation in Florida.  It was not due to being hit by debris as traffic was light and no trucks nearby.  I was driving westbound on I-4 between Orlando and Tampa when a sudden ""BOOM"" occurred. I looked around as to what happened as their was no vibration or shuttering in the steering.  I then heard glass shattering.  When I could safely pull to the side of the road to inspect, the entire front panel of the sunroof was gone except around the perimeter.  If I had not previously closed the sun shade, the tempered glass would have been in my eyes and any passengers in the front or rear seats.    The local Ford dealership initially stated that the sunroof would be covered by warranty while waiting  (6 days) for the back-ordered sunroof to be delivered.  Then after being in the Service department for 2 days, they stated it would not be covered under warranty.  I called Ford Corporate to complain, but they were only concerned if there was an open recall on the sunroof and there were none.  They seemed disinterested in the safety aspect of the issue.   I have since paid for the repair and filed an insurance claim.

Safety risk: At the time I noticed the left side trailer tire bulge, I was traveling at 60mph on a limited access highway towing trailer with a Ford F-150.  With insufficient berm to pull off the highway, in an effort to reduce the possibility of a high-speed blowout, of a tire inflated to 50 to 75 psi, I slowed to 50mph and then 40 mph as the bulge clearly grew in diameter.  Where possible I stayed halfway off the right lane but was many times forced completely onto the right lane.  Thankfully, most of the time light traffic made for smooth mergers into the left lane but on 2 occasions there were near accidents during the 3 to 4 miles before I was able to pull into the median between the north and south 2 lane highways.  AAA did not show up within the nearly 2 hours we sat there waiting/and then me changing the tire(I'm [XXX]).  The bulge was within 12"" of my head so that was a safety risk of a magnitude I tried not to think about.  When I reported the problem the next day to Kenda, the 1st thing their agent said was;  ""let all the air out right now"".  I had traveled over 400 miles with it in an enclosed truck bed hard cover. Reproduced/Confirmed Problem:  No but I have the tire and that can easily be done but not safely if standing close to the bulge. Inspected:  Not yet.  We are still traveling but I intend to do that upon my return home. Warnings: No.  I noticed it because of a ""Whitewall"" painted on the tire by either Kenda or Gulf Stream.  Normally not visible while driving, very eye-catching when bulged out 2+ inches with each rotation.

Both portions of the seats do not stay in the stowed position. Initially I assumed it was user error such as not pushing them down all the way or something not latching. After evaluation, the 2021 Sienna 3rd row seats do not have a way to latch down. When stowed and in motion the back portion of the seats begin to lift and when breaks are engaged, the car turns or slows down each section of the seats will thrust forward and lock into the seated position. The back being loose and starting to rise seems to give the bottom portion momentum to pop up quickly.

The dealer has no records identifying the “outside influence”    When the fraying was discovered on the rear center belts on our Outback in May, 2022 (Complaint #1146872), I checked all belts in the Ascent.  I discovered that the right and left third row belts had the same wear pattern as on the rear center seat belt replaced in February 2020  AND as on the 2022 Outback (Complaint 1146872).  The dealer honored the lifetime warranty on the belts and replaced them on June 8, 2022, when the car had mileage of 48439.  The wear pattern on the belt replaced on February 20, 2020, and June 8, 2022, were substantially similar to each other and to the wear pattern on the 2022 Outback.  I checked both vehicles closely to find a pinch point or some other edge that could cause the fraying.  It is not possible that our dog could have chewed any belt in the pattern displayed.    Attached are 8 photos of the belts replaced June 8.  I could not upload two photos that exceeded the allowed size.",SEAT BELTS,106250.0

One in South Carolina on 95 and the other in Florida on 95.  I check air pressure all the time and use two TPMS systems one that is tied to my GMC truck and one that came with the unit. I check tires at every rest stop and that is about every 150 miles or 3 hours.  One tire the side wall blew out ( First one) and we were able to get off the road. The second happen on a bridge and needed to keep moving because of safety concerns, that one was destroyed and had damage to my trailer.  The first tire was hotter then the other when we stopped 10 miles before failure, tire pressure was normal.  The tire was/is a Goodyear Endurance ST255/85/R16. It is important to note Goodyear did make good on the tires and the damage.. however this is happing to more and more owners of this Jayco Trailer with these tires. I am now learning Goodyear is no longer backing up this tire. This is a huge safety concern as Goodyear appear to be the only manufacturer of this size tire and the suspension system is design for the height of the tire. The Goodyear Endurance tire is a 10 ply ""E"" load rated tire with a speed rating of N. The tire load rating is to be good for 4,080 each there for the tires are to be good for 16K. I CAT scaled my trailer and It is at 13K. My complete combination truck and trailer is within specs, it is not over weight as I have a CDL and can not be putting my license  in  jeopardy.  I am in a jam as what to do to replace these tires as I have very little confidence in them. My only choice is Goodyear or purchase all new wheels and G rated tires.  It is very important to note: Goodyear customer service was very helpful, however the tire problem appears to still be there . Your welcome to look up ST255/85/R16t tire size and see if you see a ""G"" rated tire.         Thank you for looking into this matter.

Over the past year, I have noticed a significant change in my vehicle's performance.   Initially, I began hearing a constant clicking sound coming from the steering wheel or its vicinity whenever I make turns, particularly noticeable when I reverse to leave my apartment. Shortly after this sound started, I discovered that my horn is not functioning, which prevents me from alerting other drivers or signaling my presence on the road. This has made me feel unsafe while driving, as I have had several close calls with other vehicles.  Due to these issues, I sought mechanical assistance in addition to my regular maintenance. My car has been at the auto care shop for over a month, as this is their first encounter with this problem. They have proposed several solutions, but they are not confident that any of them will completely resolve the issue.  I believe this malfunction poses a risk to both myself and others on the road, and I am seeking assistance from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Prior to the onset of the clicking sounds, there were no warning signals, but I did notice  an airbag warning light had appeared. I am concerned about the potential for the airbags to either deploy unexpectedly or fail to deploy in the event of an accident. Fortunately, I have not yet experienced a situation that required their use. I will attach the documents from my mechanical visit. The car is still at that location and is available for inspection upon request. I appreciate your attention to this matter and hope to receive guidance on how to proceed.

Tires were manufactured in Poland and came installed with the vehicle. Both front tires (Bridgestone Alenza Sport A/S Size 235/55R19 105T) exhibit rubber peeling where chunks of rubber fall off the tire after only about 1.25 year of driving and approximately 15,000 miles. This presents a safety concern. VW no longer installs these tires as OEM as they switched to Pirelli Scorpion Zero or Kumho Crugen starting with model year 2023. Only first two ID.4 model years of 2021 and 2022 are affected. Note there has already been a recall on Alenza Sport A/S tires but not this exact model per NHTSA Campaign number 22T021000 recalling Bridgestone Alenza Sport A/S tires, size 235/55R20 102V (DOT date codes 2422 through 2722). VW blames Bridgestone as the tire manufacturer and Bridgestone blames VW as they claim they manufactured the tires to Volkswagen specifications. Neither will take full responsibility. The vehicle comes with staggered tires and the back tires are the same but different size (Bridgestone Alenza Sport A/S Size 255/50R19 107T).

When you remove the tailgate, none of the cameras on the vehicle work anymore. it would make sense if all cameras but the one on the tailgate would still work (since that one is no longer on the vehicle). But literally all the cameras, front, sides, and load watching, all become disabled even though they are still on the vehicle.   If there was a safety recall on the wrong screen showing up on the backup camera... I would imagine this is an even bigger safety concern not having cameras at all. Especially the load checking camera by the third breaklight. That camera could be very invaluable for safe hauling practices to be able to continually check and have eyes on your load.   And having the side view cameras available while towing is also a VERY valuable safety feature for getting through tight places such as gas stations or toll plazas.   Dodge cameras all still work when the tail gate is removed. And, I believe previous years of the F250 and 350 all still work when you remove the tailgate. This seems like a major oversight on the 2023 F350s that could be a major safety concern.

The vehicle has been inoperable for 83 days as of July 17, 2025, causing financial hardship and safety concerns.  Issue Description: Recall Details: Recall 24V-720 addresses a high-voltage battery pack defect prone to separator damage, risking vehicle fires. FCA is obligated to reprogram the battery control module or replace the battery free of charge.  Vehicle Status: Dropped off at the dealership on April 25, 2025, the vehicle remains unrepaired. The repair order is “pre-assigned,” with no technician assigned or parts ordered.  Failed Repair Attempt: On May 9, 2025, the dealership claimed repairs were complete, but charging errors emerged immediately, confirming the defect persists. The vehicle is unsafe and unusable, with restrictions against charging or parking near structures.  Failures by FCA and Dealership: Dealership Inaction: Limited testing and poor coordination with FCA’s STAR system have stalled repairs.  FCA Oversight: Jeep Case Management demanded redundant documentation, despite the recall’s clear mandate. Communication has been sparse despite frequent follow-ups.  Unpaid Reimbursements: FCA approved rental reimbursements, five invoices remain unpaid, including one approved on June 18, 2025, promised within 10-15 business days.  Requested Resolution: Immediate Repair or Refund: Complete the recall repair or issue a full cash refund of the purchase price, rejecting FCA’s fair market value credit offer.

I told the service department that I wanted to talk to Michelin about this because I felt their tires should last longer.  On October 29, the vehicle had 13,332 miles on it.    I spoke to a Michelin representative on Monday, November 8th after scanning and emailing in the service records from October 29th showing the tread measurement to be 5/32"".  The Michelin representative acknowledged that they did have the service records and the only thing needed was a phone call from Bergstrom - Middleton WI, an authorized Michelin dealer.   Bergstrom was confident additional information would be needed on the tires and asked that I schedule an appointment to come back in with the vehicle.  I did that today.  Today I was told by Bergstrom that nothing could be done because the tires were at 5/32"".  The current mileage on my vehicle is less than 14,000 miles and all 4 of these tires need to be replaced.  It appears from what I could find on the internet, a ""safe tire"" is one that has at least 6/32"" tire tread so these tires, which I might add should not have worn out at 14,000 miles, are no longer safe.  What boggles my mind is that this has been a known issue with these tires since January 2020, before I even purchased the vehicle.  I feel mislead and given the run-around by GM and Michelin.   Consumer stated Michelin has agreed to cover 70% of new tires. Consumer would like to close the case.",TIRES,143070.0

When the failure occurs, the steering becomes extremely heavy and unsafe, especially during low-speed turns or lane changes.  In September 2024, I brought my truck to an authorized Chevrolet dealership for sudden loss of power steering and electrical issues. A diagnostic was performed, and a fuse was replaced — they claimed that fixed the issue. Not even a month later, in October 2024, I brought my truck back to the dealership for the exact same issues. They confirmed a voltage drop but could not identify a specific cause. They verbally advised me they “cleaned the connectors,” which temporarily fixed the problem. Approximately one year later, in October 2025, the same issue returned — identical symptoms and voltage behavior. My truck was manufactured in August 2015, which is close to the recalled 2015 production window. Based on the symptoms and timing, I believe my truck may have been built using the same steering components or wiring harnesses as the recalled vehicles. This appears to be the same safety defect that caused the 2015 recall, only affecting a slightly newer VIN range.

Evaluating Semi-Autonomous Stop/Go and Adaptive Speed Technology Insurance Institute for Highway Safety The IIHS outlines the full list of criteria that qualifies a vehicle for a good rating: •Monitors both the driver’s gaze and hand position •Uses multiple types of rapidly escalating alerts to get the driver’s attention •Employs a fail-safe procedure to slow the vehicle, notify the manufacturer and keep automation off limits for the remainder of the drive •Requires automated lane changes to be initiated or confirmed by the driver •Does not automatically resume adaptive cruise control after a lengthy stop or if the driver is looking away from the road •Does not discourage steering by the driver while lane-centering •Prohibits automation features if the seat belt is unfastened •Prohibits automation features if automatic emergency braking or lane departure prevention and warning systems are disabled  Not terminating Semi-Autonomous Stop/Go and Adaptive Speed Technology upon manual braking creates an unsafe condition.

As a Model 3 owner for over two years, I have generally found the vehicle and its features to be reliable and safe. However, the recent update has introduced an overly stringent hands-on-wheel detection mechanism that is not only inconvenient but also potentially hazardous.  The new update requires frequent and often forceful interaction with the steering wheel to assure the system of driver presence. This change is drastically different from my previous experience, where I received only one hands-on-wheel violation in two years. The current sensitivity of the system disrupts the smooth operation of the autopilot, leading to frequent and abrupt disengagements. I have found myself struggling to maintain the system’s activation, inadvertently causing the vehicle to exit autopilot mode multiple times.  This issue goes beyond mere inconvenience; it actively detracts from driving safety. The need for constant and sometimes aggressive adjustments to satisfy the system’s requirements is distracting and can lead to erratic vehicle behavior. The irony is stark: a system designed to enhance driving safety and ease is now a source of potential danger and stress.  The unpredictability and over-sensitivity of the updated system could lead to dangerous situations, especially on highways or in heavy traffic, where sudden disengagement of the autopilot can be particularly risky. As a driver, I now find myself more focused on keeping the autopilot engaged than on the actual driving conditions and surroundings, which is surely contrary to the feature’s intended purpose.  You need to investigate this issue as a matter of urgency. Adjustments are necessary to prevent potential accidents and ensure that the tech helps, not hinders.",LANE DEPARTURE,77905.0

From my first experience of sitting in this seat, it is not functional and cannot be used when the RV is in transit without compromising someone's safety.  This was brought to the attention of the dealer and the warranty company.  They went for a test drive and experienced the same situation.  At my appointment with the warranty company , they inspected it and confirmed my problem.  They said it was not something they were able to fix,  nor was it covered under warranty.  They did state ""test drove...the rear pull out bed does seem bouncy, it unfortunately appears to be the quality of this design"" and suggested I call the manufacturer to discuss further.  When I called the manufacturer, Thor Motor Coach Inc., the representative was unaware of this problem but thanked me for letting them know and said they would look to fix this problem in future designs.  They proceeded to tell me there is nothing they can do for me and denied offering any compensation or adjustments with my vehicle.   Therefore, I'm reaching out to you to see if there is anything that can be done to resolve this issue.  I worked hard my entire life, finally retired, and bought this RV  so I could spend time with my grandchildren and bring them along with me on trips.

Specifically, the horizontal trim/molding located under the windows has defective adhesive, causing these pieces to detach from the vehicle. I am deeply concerned that if these pieces fall off while I am driving, especially on the highway, they could potentially strike another vehicle, leading to an accident.  I have brought this issue to the attention of Kia, and they are aware of the problem. In fact, the necessary parts are currently on back order, which indicates that Kia recognizes the widespread nature of the defect. However, despite this acknowledgment, no interim solution has been provided. At this point, I have had to resort to using tape, at my own expense, to temporarily secure the trim pieces and prevent them from falling off.  This situation is not only an inconvenience but also poses a serious safety risk to myself and others on the road. My question is: who would bear the liability if a piece were to detach and cause damage or injury to another driver? I believe that Kia, knowing about this defect, should be taking proactive measures to prevent such incidents from occurring.  I urge the NHTSA to investigate this issue, as it needs to be escalated due to the potential danger it presents to public safety.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.

He said that they will check my car on the recall and see what's wrong with the engine.  After some time, he called me and said: I am very sorry, but you need to replace the complete motor as this knock is caused by a problem in the bearing. And alas your car does not fall under the recall to replace this bearing.  I asked him which bearing he was talking about. And they answered that it was the one that goes into the recall under which my car did not fall. I clarified that its name sounds like: connecting rod bearing? He said: Yes.  I've had all my maintenance done on time. Engine oil changes every 5,000 miles. Even before the 8,000 to 10,000 miles. I have all the paperwork with receipts and dates in my car paperwork bag.

Affected models include the Q7 (my 2020 Q7 55 TFSI, VIN: [XXX] ), S4, S5, SQ5, A6/A7, Q8. These defects risk engine damage, sudden power loss, and catastrophic engine failure, endangering all road users.  Many owners report premature failures of cooling components (water pump, thermostat, PCV system). Failures often occur post-warranty, costing owners over $3,000 for repairs. Online forums (AudiWorld, Audizine, Reddit) document these widespread defects. The class action [XXX] et al. v. Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. alleges water pump defects in EA839-equipped Audis (incl. Q7 up to 2022).  Critical Safety Concerns:  The primary safety risk from these coolant leaks involves: Coolant Ingestion: Coolant enters vacuum lines, mixes with oil (faulty PCV), or enters intake (failing intercoolers).  Engine Malfunction: Ingestion causes misfires, drivability issues, and sudden power loss during operation.  Catastrophic Engine Failure: Severe coolant ingestion can cause catastrophic engine failure, risking loss of control and collisions if the engine seizes/fails at speed. Sudden engine malfunction/failure while driving due to this systemic defect warrants immediate NHTSA investigation.  Audi of America is aware. My contact (Mike, Ext. 43252) confirmed Audi is not addressing this widespread failure. Audi's inaction necessitates NHTSA intervention for consumer and road safety.  Affected owners urge NHTSA to:  Initiate a formal investigation into systemic coolant leak issues and component failures in EA839-equipped Audi vehicles. Assess the safety risks, including potential engine failure and loss of vehicle control. If warranted, issue a safety recall for affected vehicles to prevent accidents and injuries.

This was an extremely dangerous situation as the liftgate could have seriously injured someone who may have been underneath when the support cylinder failed.

The configuration matters (with rear heated/recline seats) because it gets caught in the panel that is unique to this configuration.  The seat belts appear to work, but if you pull it angled too far away from the door (toward the middle of the car), the belt gets caught in the plastic panel, and then you can't get it to retract unless you force it back out of the plastic and out toward the door.  High back booster seats reposition the seat belt in such a way so that this issue occurs every time. We tried with 3 different brands. The issue is that you can install the booster fine, and buckle your child in, without noticing a problem. But if that child leans forward at any point, the seat belt stays loose. We did not notice the first time driving with a high back booster, and I'm sure other parents would not, either.  We tried with a backless booster, as well. These do not reposition the seat belt as much, and still the issue occurs but not as consistently. I tried as an adult without any booster seat, and was able to replicate as well, meaning any child, regardless of size, could end up with the seat belt hanging loose if they lean at any point.  I brought this to our local Jaguar dealership repair technicians, and they said it was not an issue and suggested that instead we pull the seatbelt all the way out then retract, so that it locks in place tight across our child using the automatic locking retractor mechanism. This is obviously extremely unsafe and not the real solution to this issue.  We're left unable to use high back boosters with this car, and even unable to use backless boosters safely.

My friend removed it on scene and put it in the van. 1. 12 Jan drove it to California. Turned in my van and awning to [XXX], Santa Fe Springs, CA on 13 January.   I haven’t heard from the dealership but have a lot of email correspondence from the manufacturer, Thor. I don’t know what they did with the part.  Mileage was 7,740 miles.  I opened the awning once at my house right after I bought it.  It’s never been opened since. 2.  I could have been injured or died if it would have hit something or someone else and I would have been traveling at a higher rate of speed.   Others driving could have been injured or died and at the very least a great deal of property damage. 3. I have no idea what Mike Thompson Dealership did when I dropped it off.  My service advisor said they were going to have the local Thor Rep look at it to determine if it was under warranty.  After service Rep told me this, I contacted Thor and described what happened and the lady said it was absolutely covered under warranty.  I have been in email contact with Thor and have all the emails between us but can’t figure out how to get them in this report. 4. I don’t know when and if the local Thor Rep reviewed the damage.  Dealership has not communicated with me.   5.  Absolutely no warning this would happen.  Like I said, as it was happening and when I pulled over, the sound of the awning deploying was coming from the BMPro.

Upon returning home I noticed that two sensors had become dislodged and fallen into the bumper. They appear to only have been held on by double sided tape. There are no obvious signs of impact, I have not had any collision, and the vehicle was purchased new.  The failure appears to be one of the following 3 potential issues: 1) It could possibly be a very poor design choice, by Honda, to tape the parking sensors onto the vehicle.  I don't understand why the mounting was not engineered to be injection molded as part of the lower garnish.  That would easily reduce the vehicle parts count. 2) It may also be a poor decision in materials by the manufacturer.  Honda may have specified an inferior adhesive that is incapable of sustaining the forces involved, or not capable of withstanding the exterior climate. 3) Least likely, but still possible, is the possibility that Honda's trusted retail partner, Conicelli Honda 19428, sold me a car with pre-existing damage that was not disclosed.  A malfunctioning safety systems is dangerous to both the driver, other vehicles, and human life. Not only are the excessive malfunctioning notification a distraction to the driver, if a child was to run out in front of the vehicle, the vehicle would not recognize them and they could be hurt.  Additionally if it triggers any other safety features such as automatic breaking, it could cause accident, especially if multiple vehicles in the road are experiencing the same issue.

I contacted two other Dodge dealerships in East Texas as well as an independent diesel mechanic who confirmed the same thing - this part would not be available until August 2023.  I had Marshall dealership to put my name on list with others who had the same issue, and I had to continue driving the vehicle with the ABS system compromised, with the awareness and care knowing that this is a safety concern.  August 2023, had not heard back from the dealership so I called and asked about the ABS controller issue.

It is now mid September and I am having to continue driving with safety compromised due to the bad ABS controller and Dodge not doing anything to address this situation for me or what I understand are several others.

By ""picks up"" I mean the visual indication in the right side mirror is lighted when the vehicle is in the blind spot.

After additional discussion with the service manage the dealer verbally admitted the system was not detecting other cars on the right side of the vehicle consistently but as there was no electrical fault detected in the system, it must be OK and it was not a repairable issue.

It says there is a DEFECT that can cause a crash.  It says “overtime, due to initial variation in rear stabilizer bracket dimensions, the rear stabilizer bracket bolts may loosen and possibly detach”.   I purchased my Subaru Forester Touring model 2-2-2019. On 7-20-2020 with only 19;413 miles I experienced a very loud rattle in the rear. My local dealer in Albuquerque, NM found that both rear stabilizer bolts were very loose and about to fall out. They retorqued them to specification and checked for a recall. Of course they found none and said someone at the factory probably didn’t torque to the correct value.   Now I receive this WRD-21 notice. I called Subaru customer service to find out why  this defect is fixed by a simple retorquing of the bolts. Based on their own statement the loosening is caused by a manufacturing error in the stabilizer bracket dimensions. Simple retorquing in my opinion will not fix the defect but only fix the symptoms and probably the bots will become loose again over time due to the imperfections in the stabilizer bracket dimensions as they admitted.   Subaru told me all recalls are approved by the NHTSA before it is sent out. So some engineer at NHTSA must have analyzed the problem and their proposed solution and approved it.  I disagree with the approval and believe the bolts will loosen again under normal use. Many Subaru owners buy the Forrester model for off road use on rough roads. I fear it will happen to me again.   I request NHTSA re-examine this recall and require Subaru to issue another recall to perform a permanent fix to this admitted safety defect in their product.

This happens more often if she crosses her legs or reclines the seat too much.  As if she's not putting enough weight directly on the seat airbag sensor.  I understand this is a common complaint and have seen many threads about it in the online forums and on Reddit.  I spoke with the Rivian Service Center in Gaithersburg, MD, on Nov. 1 and was told it is ""within spec"".  However it is my opinion that they should look into the weight threshold on the seat and ensure that it stays on when people are sitting there.  Perhaps by tying it into the seatbelt buckle sensor?

I come to a complete stop, my car goes into Idle Stop and when I release the brake to accelerate and the engine re-engages, this error flashes.   And, I can continue to drive.  Prior to this recall work, I had never received this error.  In addition to this error code, on January 24, 2024, I was at a complete stop on a freeway offramp.  When I released the brake and tried to accelerate, my car would not engage and very loud clunk, followed by the orange ""Brake System"" light flashed on.  Eventually my car engaged and we were able to drive.  The clunk was so loud my teenage children asked me if we were hit by another car.  On, Friday January 25, 2024 after dropping the car off at the dealership we were told that ""The diagnostics have revealed a 'defective Multipurpose Camera and AIM'.

About three weeks ago I was driving down the road at 55 mph when my transmission disengaged and I coasted to a stop.  Even though my engine was running I couldn't go forward or backward at all, and so I had it towed to a local mechanic.  The mechanic said that this was a common problem with the Escape, that I was going to have to replace the entire transmission, and that it would take about two months to get a new transmission in.  About two weeks ago I got a notice from Ford Motor Co. about a recall on my Escape for another transmission issue (Ref. Safety Recall Notice 22S43/NHTSA Recall 22V413).  I called my local dealership and was told that my transmission issue was completely different than the recall problem because the recall only dealt with a transmission that shifted differently from the park position, and not a transmission that didn't engage at all.  They also said that they would call me when they got the parts in.  I have no idea how to resolve this issue.  Do I park my vehicle until Ford gets the parts in in the 4th quarter of 2022 to see if this fixes my problem, and only then get the transmission replaced afterwards?  If it takes 2 months or more to get a new transmission in, I could see this taking a year before I have my vehicle repaired.  If I have the transmission replaced by the local mechanic, it will costs me $6,200.00, and take two months to repair.  This would probably save me some money over the dealership cost to repair it, but would void any subsequent work that they might do?  Do you have any suggestions as to I might be able to resolve this problem?

This is a serious problem that has the potential to injure me. Since I'm tall, and my wife is short, the seat starts moving forward as I get in, and it starts to crush me. It's too hard to get back out, and I'm not always able to select my seat configuration quickly enough. If I happen to be carrying something as I get into the car, then that object usually is compressed between me and the steering wheel. There have been times where I didn't have my legs in fully, and they started to get crushed by the seat pushing them forward into the steering wheel.  I've talked to Tesla about this several times. Tesla employees have told me that they hear about this problem regularly, but they don't have a way to fix it. And when I ask how to contact Tesla, they tell me use Twitter. I think Tesla's service department should have a method to communicate customer complaints directly.  No one has given me any feedback indicating that they intend to do anything, even though they acknowledge that this is dangerous.  I also wonder if it is possible that this might happen while I'm driving! For example, what would happen if the battery on my phone drained? The bluetooth connection would be lost. Would the car then pair to my wife's phone and readjust the seats?  Of course, there is a simple fix. Instead of doing the automatic but stupid and dangerous adjustment, it should just ask for my confirmation. And never automatically go into a mode of ""let's crush the driver""!

On the way to Tallahassee on Highway 27 maybe a mile east of Capps, Fl noticed some tire debris behind me in side mirrors.  My girlfriend was following me, called and alerted me something appeared to be wrong and tire and other debris was coming off the bottom right side of the coach.  I was unable to pull over immediately due to traffic safety concerns and lack of side lane for parking.  I was able to park at Hwy 19 to I-10 exit at Capps, where assessed the situation.  The tire and rim was totally destroyed along with parts of the wheel well and skirt.  I was able to install the spare wheel and continue to Tallahassee.  Prior to moving the coach, I verified air pressure in all tires based on the side wall ratings using tire gauge and portable air compressor.  My speed was between 45mph and 55mph.  Second tire failure: This happened at Camping World repair shop around September 28, 2023.  Tire failure was on the same side as the previous one, right side of coach.  I was told the tire spontaneously exploded without any signs of tire failure prior.  As far as I know, there were no changes in air pressure or modifications to the wheel.  The wheel had been removed and inspected prior during axle maintenance.  I was told immediately after the the incident, they reduced air pressures on the remaining wheels for safety concerns.  Tires had no more than 2,000 miles and regularly checked inflation, travelling and parked.  I bought the coach new in 2022 and never noticed any tire rot, bulging or other or damage.

Every time I drive on two-lane roads, I receive a bright orange “Brake” warning from the Automatic Emergency Braking system when vehicles in the opposite lane are passing by. The system falsely detects an imminent collision, even though the oncoming vehicles are safely in their lane.  The system then applies the brakes unnecessarily. Most of the time it brakes mildly, but on at least two occasions it has braked very hard, causing the vehicle behind me to nearly rear-end my car. This creates a significant and dangerous situation, as it could easily cause an accident.  I now have to disable the automatic braking system every time I drive. During my last drive, after disabling the system, I received a warning message stating: “ABS Failure — Take to Dealer.”  I have also experienced dangerous behavior from the Lane Departure Warning/Assist system. When exiting the freeway, if the lane lines disappear or become unclear, the vehicle has slammed on the brakes suddenly. On one occasion, this caused me severe whiplash. Thankfully, I was alone in the car — if my young children had been passengers, they could have suffered serious neck injuries.  I have taken the vehicle to the Honda dealer and independent mechanics. Each time, they have only cleared the codes and told me it was due to “dirty sensors.” The warnings and braking issues, however, keep coming back.  This issue is persistent, reproducible, and unsafe.

Had to coast/navigate over two lanes while the car was slowing to make it to the shoulder, and was stuck on the shoulder while the engine cooled down enough to leave the shoulder.   Jim Ellis Chevrolet confirmed the failed EGR valve, but have so far been able to reproduce the overheating in the shop. Replacing the EGR valve is estimated at $1100, with GM providing a $250 warranty assistance.  I have confirmed with other Volt owners that this is a very common issue which affects all GM Volt 2 cars manufactured between 2016 and 2019. Enough of the EGR valves have failed that the part is in short supply with possible wait times of over 6 months.   The EGR Valve is part of the emissions system. However, the problem appears to be (unconfirmed) a manufacturing defect in the control board for the valve. This fails, causing the engine block F3 fuse to blow. This fuse also powers the engine coolant pump, which is what takes this from an emissions problem to a safety problem--which can cause the car to shut down suddenly.

Component that failed:  The leaf springs on the rear axle broke in half.  This RV has two rear axles.  The leaf springs that broke were both on the rear axle. 2.  How was your safety put at risk?:  If the springs broke while at highway speeds, control of the Travel Trailer could have been lost. 3.  Has the problem been confirmed by a dealer or independent service center?:  Yes.  Both broken leaf springs have been replaced. 4.  Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representative?:  No. 5.  Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear?  No warnings.  We did hear a ""pop noise"" when one of the springs snapped/broke.  The leaf spring broke while making a U-turn.  Keystone RV was notified of this spring failure.  I wanted Keystone RV to know of this problem in the event other RV Trailer Trailers are experiencing similar suspension failures.   I do not overload the travel trailer.   The RV Travel Trailer is used primarily in the Rocky Mountain West.  So the leaf springs were not subject to salt air and/or high humidity that would lead to corrosion.  I drive very conservatively.  I am always the slowest vehicle on the highway.  I do not camp off-road.  The RV Travel Trailer is 6 1/2 years old.

This defect has left me unable to access the fuel tank, presenting a serious safety risk—particularly the possibility of being stranded without fuel, which poses a threat to both driver and passenger safety.  I have been informed by both Genesis Customer Care and the Genesis dealership in Huntsville, Alabama that this issue is common and recurring across multiple Genesis models. It is not the result of wear and tear, and is unrelated to mileage. This is a design or mechanical flaw that directly compromises vehicle operability.  Despite acknowledgment that this is a known defect, Genesis has refused to resolve the issue under warranty, even though it is clearly a safety-related failure. I have attempted to escalate the matter internally, but have encountered delay, avoidance, and a refusal to take accountability.  If this defect were to leave me or my family stranded without access to fuel—especially in extreme weather or on a busy highway—it could result in severe consequences. I believe this issue merits formal investigation and potential recall consideration.  I respectfully request that the NHTSA review this issue and consider initiating an investigation to determine whether a recall or safety bulletin is warranted.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.",FUEL/PROPULSION SYSTEM,74020.0
